# PondWaterðŸ’§

## Introduction

Provide a brief introduction to your subgraph, including its purpose and the type of data it indexes. Mention the main Ethereum contracts it interacts with (PondWater, PondClaims, PondCoin, MiningRigV3, Distillery, and ERC20Template) and the kind of events it tracks.

## Subgraph Specification

- **Spec Version**: `1.0.0` - Indicates the version of the subgraph manifest specification.
- **Indexer Hints**:
  - `prune: auto` - Advises indexers on data pruning strategies.

## Schema Definition

Schema location: `./schema.graphql` - Path to the GraphQL schema file.

### Entities

## Querying the Subgraph

After detailing the data sources and mappings, provide comprehensive examples and explanations for querying each entity within the subgraph. This section should enable users to understand how to retrieve and manipulate the data indexed by your subgraph effectively.

### OwnershipTransferred Query

```graphql
query {
  ownershipTransferreds {
    id
    previousOwner
    newOwner
    blockNumber
    blockTimestamp
    transactionHash
  }
}

### Approval Query

```graphql
query {
  approvals(where: {owner: "0x..."}, orderBy: value, orderDirection: desc) {
    id
    owner
    spender
    value
    blockNumber
    blockTimestamp
    transactionHash
  }
}

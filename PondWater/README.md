# Pond0x: PondWaterðŸ’§

## Introduction

The PondWater subgraph is an integral part of the decentralized web, leveraging The Graph Protocol to index and query data from the Ethereum blockchain. The Graph is a powerful tool that transforms blockchain data into easily accessible and interpretable information, addressing a common challenge in the decentralized space: the difficulty of retrieving detailed and structured data from blockchains using traditional APIs and block explorers. These conventional methods often fall short in providing real-time, indexed data that can be queried efficiently. The Graph fills this gap by allowing developers to create and publish open APIs, known as subgraphs, which applications can query using GraphQL.

PondWater subgraph specifically targets a unique dataset within the Ethereum ecosystem, focusing on a collection of interconnected contracts, including PondWater, PondClaims, PondCoin, MiningRigV3, Distillery, and ERC20Template. By indexing events emitted by these contracts, the subgraph makes a wide range of data readily available and searchable. This data encompasses various blockchain activities, from token transfers and approvals in PondCoin to ownership changes in PondClaims, and more specialized events like mining operations in MiningRigV3 and contract interactions within Distillery and PondWater.

The purpose of the PondWater subgraph is multifaceted: it not only enhances transparency and accessibility of blockchain data for developers and users alike but also supports real-time data analysis, dApp development, and broader research within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. By providing a structured and queryable interface to the rich data landscape of these Ethereum contracts, the PondWater subgraph empowers developers to build more intuitive and responsive applications, fostering innovation and user engagement in the DeFi ecosystem.

### Entities

#### Lock

- **Description**: Represents a lock event in the PondWater contract. Includes details such as the locker's address, the amount locked, the lock duration, and transaction metadata.
- **Fields**:
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the lock event.
  - `locker`: The address of the locker.
  - `PondWater_id`: The unique identifier for the PondWater event.
  - `locked`: The amount locked.
  - `startsAt`: The start time of the lock.
  - `lockedFor`: The duration of the lock.
  - `blockNumber`: The block number of the lock event.
  - `blockTimestamp`: The timestamp of the block.
  - `transactionHash`: The transaction hash of the lock event.

#### [Other Entities]

For each additional entity (`NewStream`, `OuncesObserved`, `Unlock`, `OwnershipTransferred`, `Approval`, `Transfer`, `ClaimBooster`, `Mine`, `ExecutionSuccess`, `SafeReceived`, `ExecutionFailure`, `RemovedOwner`, `AddedOwner`), provide a structured description similar to the Lock entity.

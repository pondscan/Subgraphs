# Pond0x: PondWaterðŸ’§

## Introduction

The PondWater subgraph, powered by The Graph Protocol, is a transformative tool that significantly enhances the capabilities of the decentralized web. By meticulously indexing data from key Pond0x contracts, it unlocks a new realm of possibilities for developers and users alike. The Graph Protocol acts as a bridge between complex blockchain data and the end user, providing a structured and efficient way to access information that is often opaque and challenging to retrieve through traditional means like block explorers.

This subgraph taps into the rich vein of data produced by Pond0x contracts including PondWater, PondClaims, PondCoin, MiningRigV3, GnosisProxySafe, the Uniswap Factories & Routers, etc. It indexes a wide array of events, from token transactions and contract interactions to more nuanced activities like mining operations and swap. What makes the PondWater subgraph particularly powerful is its ability to transform this raw data into a format that's easily queryable using GraphQL, a modern query language. This enables users to craft precise queries to extract the exact data they need, whether for displaying transaction histories, monitoring activity or interpretting real-time blockchain data into visuals for analysis.

Moreover, The Graph Protocol facilitates real-time data indexing, meaning the PondWater subgraph can offer up-to-the-minute data, a critical requirement for operating in the dynamic environments of crypto 2.0. This capability not only enhances user experience by providing timely and accurate information but also supports complex data analysis and decision-making processes that are essential in the fast-paced ecosystem.

In essence, the PondWater subgraph, by leveraging The Graph Protocol, becomes an indispensable tool, enabling more efficient data access, richer user interfaces, and ultimately, fostering innovation and growth in the crypto community.

    id
    locker
    locked
    startsAt
    lockedFor
    blockNumber
    blockTimestamp
  }
}
```

{
  locks(orderBy: locker) {
    locker
    locked
  }
}
```

#### Example Query: Tracking Large Transfers from "The Distillery"

This query filters for transfer events originating from "The Distillery" wallet, specifically targeting transactions that exceed a significant value threshold, indicating substantial financial activity.

```graphql
{
  transfers(where: {from: "0x17CC6042605381c158D2adab487434Bde79Aa61C", value_gt: "100000000000000000000"}, first: 10, orderBy: blockTimestamp, orderDirection: desc) {
    id
    from
    to
    value
    blockNumber
    blockTimestamp
    tokenName
    tokenSymbol
